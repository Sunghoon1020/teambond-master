This is the TeamBond App made for DEV 640 Web Programming II.

Our social networking app will be called "TeamBond" and will be an internal platform for employees to connect, communicate, and build community within the organization. The app will feature user profiles, private messaging, groups, and a news feed where employees can share updates, photos, and videos related to work and their personal lives. # teambond-master
